Step .05
Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 400Â°. Grease 2 large baking sheets with cooking spray.
Step 2
Divide pizza dough into 4 pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll one piece to an 8" circle about 1/4" thick. Spoon one-quarter of pizza sauce in middle of dough, then dot with one-quarter of ricotta. Top with one-quarter of pepperoni and one-quarter of mozzarella.
Step 3
Gently fold dough in half, dampen seams with water, and pinch together, then crimp edges all around. Repeat with remaining dough, sauce, ricotta, pepperoni, and mozzarella. Transfer to prepared sheets. Brush tops with oil; sprinkle with salt. Using kitchen scissors or a sharp knife, slit tops in 2 to 3 spots to create steam vents.
Step 4
Bake calzones, brushing with oil and rotating sheets top to bottom halfway through, until tops are golden brown and filling is bubbling, about 20 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before cutting open.
